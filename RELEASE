Version 0.4.0 - 2010-09-02

    This is the first stable release of the 0.4 stable branch. That means we have done a feature freeze and chosen an API that will stay througout the next releases in the 0.4 branch. 

    Lunch 0.4 has an API that is slightly different than Lunch in the 0.2 series. Among the most important changes is the deprecation of the "title" keyword of the "add_command" function in favour of the "identifier" one. Same applies for "sleep" in favour of "sleep_after". The "priority", "order" and "log_file" keywords are also deprecated. 

    Lunch can now be used as a library to spawn processes from a Python application. The lunch-slave script must be installed on every host on which the operator wants to launch processes.
