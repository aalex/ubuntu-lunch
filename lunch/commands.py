A L{lunch.commands.Command} is the interface to what command line the user wants to starts. 

Once given to a L{lunch.master.Master}, each command starts a lunch-slave process, communicating with it via its stdin and stdout. 
The lunch-slave is then told which command to launch and asked to launch it, and stop it, on-demand.
